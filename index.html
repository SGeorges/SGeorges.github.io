                            I'm an aspiring web developer looking to make a start from unorthodox beginnings. After highschool I attended 
                            Muhlenberg College to find what I wanted to do with my life. I had an affinity towards math and sciences but I
                            took this opportunity to take other courses I normally wouldn't have. Even though this time should've been spent 
                            discovering I was young and close-minded.
                            
                            <br><br> 
                            
                            After two years I transferred into Drexel University to pursue a degree 
                            in Chemical Engineering. After graduating from Drexel I spent the next five years working in the Environmental
                            Engineering field. With clients ranging from simple family farmers to the US Navy I'd viewed a wide spectrum fo the 
                            field I was in, but looking into the future it wasn't where I wanted to be. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="card-text bodyText mb-3">
                            It was a field where I felt my creativity and freedom were restricted so I decided
                            to go for broke and change my career pathway to something I personally enjoy. Even though I can't stress 
                            how much I loved working outside in the extreme heat or cold, fighting off ticks, chiggers, bees, spiders,
                            and sacrificing my well-being for the sake of the client, it was time for a change. 
                        </p>

                            So here I am. Re-educated and revitalized with the desire to change the world in a 
                            vastly different setting. Thanks for checking out my profile!
